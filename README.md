# AdventOfCode

This repo contains my own (dmachaj) personal solutions to various Advent of Code challenges.  This repo is public but it is __not__ licensed for any sort of reuse or redistribution.

Advent of Code is a time-based challenge so the code is on the sloppy side and is not a reflection of what I consider to be production-quality code.  Similarly the build and verification scripts are super quick&dirty but are fast and effective enough for this usage.
